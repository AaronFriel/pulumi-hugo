Infrastructure in Pulumi is organized into Projects. Each Project is a single program that, when run, declares the desired infrastructure for Pulumi to manage.

## Create a directory

Each Pulumi Project lives in its own directory. Create one now and change into it:

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
```

> Pulumi will use the directory name as your project name by default. To create an independent project, simply name the directory differently.

## Initialize your project

A Pulumi Project is just a directory with some files in it. It's possible for you to create a new one by hand. The `pulumi new` command, however, automates the process:

{{< chooser language "typescript,python,go,csharp" / >}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ pulumi new typescript -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ pulumi new python -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash
$ pulumi new go -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash
$ pulumi new csharp -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

This prints output similar to the following with a bit more information and status as it goes:

```
Created stack 'dev'

Creating virtual environment...

Finished creating virtual environment

Updating pip, setuptools, and wheel in virtual environment...
...
Your new project is ready to go! âœ¨

To perform an initial deployment, run 'pulumi up'
```

This command creates all the files we need, initializes a new stack named `dev` (an instance of our project), and installs the needed package dependencies from PyPi.

## Inspect the new project

{{< chooser language "typescript,python,go,csharp" />}}

Our project is comprised of multiple files:

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

NEED TYPESCRIPT THINGS HERE

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

* `__main__.py`: your program's main entrypoint file
* `requirements.txt`: your project's Python dependency information
* `Pulumi.yaml`: your project's metadata, containing its name and language
* `venv`: a [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) for your project

Run `cat __main__.py` to see the contents of your project's empty program:

```python
"""A Python Pulumi program"""

import pulumi
```

Feel free to explore the other files, although we won't be editing any of them by hand. Note that the Pulumi CLI creates a virtual environment, `venv`, for the project.
